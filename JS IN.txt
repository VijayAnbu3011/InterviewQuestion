21.`call`, `apply`, and `bind` are three important methods in JavaScript that are used to manipulate the `this` context of a function and can also be used to pass arguments to a function. They are commonly used in various programming scenarios, especially when dealing with function invocation and context management.

 **`call()` Method:**
   The `call()` method is used to invoke a function immediately, specifying the value of `this` and passing arguments individually.

   Syntax:
   ```javascript
   function.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...);
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function greet(message) {
     console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}!`);
   }

   const person = { name: 'Alice' };

   greet.call(person, 'Hello');
   ```

 **`apply()` Method:**
   The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it accepts arguments as an array or array-like object.

   Syntax:
   ```javascript
   function.apply(thisArg, [argsArray]);
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function sum(a, b) {
     return a + b;
   }

   const numbers = [5, 10];

   const result = sum.apply(null, numbers);
   ```

 **`bind()` Method:**
   The `bind()` method creates a new function with a specified `this` value and partially applied arguments. The original function is not invoked immediately.

   Syntax:
   ```javascript
   function.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...);
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function sayHi() {
     console.log(`Hi, ${this.name}!`);
   }

   const person = { name: 'Bob' };
   const greet = sayHi.bind(person);

   greet();
   ```

**Key Differences:**

- `call()` and `apply()` immediately invoke the function, while `bind()` returns a new function with the bound context and arguments.
- `call()` takes individual arguments, while `apply()` takes an array or array-like object of arguments.
- All three methods allow you to explicitly set the `this` context for a function.

**Common Use Cases:**

- Changing the context of a function call to a specific object.
- Using methods from one object on another object without inheritance.
- Function borrowing and reuse.
- Creating functions with preset arguments for event handling.

These methods are powerful tools for managing the context and arguments of function calls in JavaScript, making them essential for writing clean and modular code. Understanding how to use `call`, `apply`, and `bind` effectively can greatly enhance your ability to work with functions and objects in various programming scenarios.
